            On the first day of each month, we will raffle a predetermined
            amount of winners decided by the community, these winners will split
            1% of that month's gross revenue brought in by the StrEATS brand
            paid out in ETH/WETH. Based on 2021’s sales, that's about $5,000+ a
            month that we will be giving back to our holders, completely free!{" "}

            Hidden within the metadata of the un-revealed Tenacious Tacos NFT
            collection there will be 7 Golden Tacos, and the StrEATS Mascot
            1-of-1. The 7 Golden Tacos will correlate to the 7 different tacos
            we serve in our restaurant, and the holders of these Golden Tacos
            will receive monthly payments in ETH/WETH, loosely based around the
            number of sales the corresponding menu item has for that month.
            Based off of 2021’s sales, the yearly income for the holders of the
            7 Golden Tacos will be as follows: ~$5000 annually for the holder of
            the Golden Fish Taco ~$4500 annually for the holder of the Golden
            Mango Shrimp Taco ~$3000 annually for the holder of the Golden Beef
            Taco ~$2500 annually for the holder of the Golden Buffalo Chicken
            Taco ~$2000 annually for the holder of the Golden Pork Taco ~$2000
            annually for the holder of the Golden Chicken Taco ~$1500 annually
            for the holder of the Golden Feature Taco As for the StrEATS Mascot,
            it will have a 1-of-1 trait, the illusive ‘Black Card’, this trait
            entitles the holder to eat for free at all StrEATS brand locations,
            for life!
