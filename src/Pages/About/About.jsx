          In 2017 a group of like-minded people got together and opened
          @streatscanada’s first restaurant location in Canada. Since its
          inception, StrEATS has grown from its original standalone store, to a
          franchise composed of 15 locations, spread all across Canada. Amidst a
          global pandemic and multiple government shut downs, through hard work
          and impeccable management, StrEATS managed to have its most successful
          year to date. Achieving $6m in revenue, and a brand growth of 75%.
          With projected earnings in 2022 being upwards of $10m, and plans to
          expand into the US, StrEATS is showing absolutely no sign of slowing
          down, and we want to bring you with us! If you would like to learn
          more about the StrEATS brand check us out on our website. So how does
          this relate to NFTs, and what do we hope to achieve through the
          Tenacious Tacos project? In mid 2021, our resident crypto degens
          @nigelnim and @Aliterit_ became involved in Web3. After falling in
          love with the community and innovation of the space they decided to
          on-board the rest of our team. After taking the last few months to
          learn the benefits of the space, as well as some difficult lessons, we
          came together to create Tenacious Tacos. Our vision with this project
          is to become closer with our community, and create the opportunity for
          you to share in our growing success. <br /> Whether you're a regular
          customer or living overseas, we hope to create value for each and
          every one of you through ownership of our NFT. The team at StrEATS
          Kitchen are truly excited to begin building within this community, and
          we look forward to meeting all of you in our Discord server.
